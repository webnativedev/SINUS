# Getting Started

* Create a test project
* install SINUS via nuget
  * SINUS can be used for UI-Tests and Unit Tests
  * consider to not create any other test project for testing the externally visible API
    (implementing small UI wrappers enables manual testing that is fully automatable).
  * You might want to create another project for internal APIs using the AssemblyAttributes including System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleTo.
* (Optionally) Create a "TestInitializer" (or similar named class) that covers the startup of a test
  * AssemblyInitialize, ClassInitialize - usage example can be seen at (TestInitializer.cs in the demo test project).
* Create a class and attribute it with \[TestClass\]
* inherit the class from TestBase
* Create a method and attribute it with \[TestMethod\]
* Instead of Arrange-Act-Assert use an inherited method Test() for browser-based testing or for testing without a UI.
* With the Given part (use intelliSense) you can spin-up a browser and optionally a System-Under-Test (SUT) in-memory or public (meaning reachable via network outside the test).
  * use public SUT configuration for UI tests, because the web driver spawns outside the unit test in a separate process.
  * consider to use components for mocking / test doubles and mocking modes in the systems to test
* With the When part (use intelliSense) you can perform the main action and here no action means a prepared test, that can not yet be evaluated properly.
* With the Then part (use intelliSense) you can perform checks on the action.
  * FluentAssertions is supported and comes as dependency as mainly supported Assertion Library helping you writing tests more expressive.
* You can optionally add some debug information at the end in the "Debug" phase (mostly used for printing the current state; this is supported by DebugPrint).
* Consider using StyleCop (also for the test-project)
  * Opinionated: remove CS1591, SA1600 for tests to remove the necessary XML documentation which is already covered via method name and description fields of SINUS.
* Consider using a memory leak analysis tool or directly a supporting nuget package.
  * (no own experience yet:) https://www.jetbrains.com/dotmemory/unit/ | https://www.nuget.org/packages/JetBrains.DotMemoryUnit/
  * Optional: SINUS supports you in finding memory leaks for browser and spinned up system-under-test-instances. Additionally zombie chrome processes can be observed and also the test results folder for the amount of log folders.
